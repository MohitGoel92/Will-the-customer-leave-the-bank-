# Will the customer leave the bank?

**Task: Customer behaviour predictions**

We are currently working within the data science team of a bank. We have been tasked to produce a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will leave or stay with the bank, depending on some independent variables. 

We will be using an "Artificial Neural Network" to complete this business task.

## Artificial Neural Networks

An Artificial Neural Network is a "Deep Learning" model that can be used for regression and classification. We create an artificial structure where we have nodes that represent neurons.
